# Bridge and Torch Problem

This project implements a solution to the classic "Bridge and Torch" problem using BFS in Python.

## Features

- Full state representation using tuples and sets
- Legal state generation using all allowed operator combinations
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the minimal crossing time //still working on it

## How to run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash
python bridge_and_torch.py
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add DFS with Iterative Deepening

- Add graphical state visualization

- Use OOP for better structure
